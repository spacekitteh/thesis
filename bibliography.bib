abstract = {In order to achieve the best possible control of a particular system, it is clear that as much information about the system as possible should be used when designing the controller. This leads to a controller specifically tailored to the system being controlled. Unfortunately, this is expensive in terms of design time and expertise, and a number of approaches have been suggested to overcome this problem. The approach taken by physical-model-based control is to model the system in a generic manner and then automatically design the controller based on this model. This process requires symbolic algebra to enable the controller to be designed.},

Through the detailed bond graphs of sub-models and the total bond graph of the system, the corresponding port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) models for subsystems and the whole system are also extracted. Finally, the bond graph and the PCH model of DFWPS are validated by the simulations in 20sim.},

This framework can be used as a tool to facilitate design refinement from behavioural and functional modelling to explore system architecture and for rapid prototyping of mechatronic systems such as UAVs.

@article{Dauphin-Tanguy1999a,
abstract = {An active or controlled system is generally composed of two parts: a passive basis and a control architecture containing actuators and sensors. When dealing with such a system, the first point usually considered is the study of the system without control. To do this, we need a model in order to get simulation-based results on the frequency domain and dynamical behaviour for dimensioning purpose. The second step is then to design a control architecture, with its actuators and sensors, specified in a way allowing the objectives to be reached as accurately and cheaply as possible. Since many years, the bond graph methodology has shown its qualities for modelling and generation of physical insight, specially when applied to multidisciplinary systems. The aim of this paper is to show how a bond graph model may be used for analysis of structural properties, i.e., properties depending only on the model structure and on the type of elements composing it, but not on the numerical values of the parameters. The properties pointed out in this way are generic, and can be used for “integrated design”, i.e., the simultaneous design of the passive system model, its control architecture and control laws for specific aims. The proposed methodology depends on causal manipulations on the bond graph model (assignment of integral and derivative causality, causal path and loops); its application may necessitate a return to the model in order to check and sometimes modify the modelling hypotheses. The proposed procedure is implemented on an example, which will be the guideline of the presentation.},

abstract = {A large number of methods have been developed in order to solve the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of mechanical systems, from a generic treatment through to finite elements. For accuracy to be guaranteed in the results, a through discrete-parameters procedure should be performed on the model which, when many degrees of freedom are involved, implies resolution of a high-order system at the expense of considerable computer time. An alternative method is proposed in this paper for calculating natural frequencies and modes based on building the dynamic matrix through Bond Graph techniques.},

abstract = {In the last few years a Modelica library for spacecraft modelling and simulation has been developed, on the basis of the Modelica Multibody Library. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate improvements in terms of simulation accuracy and efﬁciency which can be obtained by using Keplerian or Equinoctial parameters instead of Cartesian coordinates as state variables in the spacecraft model. The rigid body model of the standard MultiBody library is extended by adding the equations deﬁning a transformation of the body centerof-mass coodinates from Keplerian and Equinoctial parameters to Cartesian coordinates, and by setting the former as preferred states, instead of the latter. The remaining parts of the model, including the model of the gravitational ﬁeld, are left untouched, thus ensuring maximum re-usability of third-party code. The results shown in the paper demonstrate the superior accuracy and speed of computation in the reference case of a point-mass gravity ﬁeld.},

@article{Lichiardopol2010,
abstract = {Duality as a general notion has been discussed previously in multiple domains. The field of system modeling, analysis and control has used it for quite some time. The duality between the controllability and the observability is well known, especially in the case of the linear time-invariant systems. But when it comes to the linear systems in general, time-invariant or otherwise, the definitions become ambiguous. Even though there have been papers which use the state space representation or the module theoretical approach, a unified description has not been found yet. This paper is meant to fill in this gap, by using the bond graph representation. The bond graph perspective offers a global overview because the bond graph is a graphical tool which can be seen both as a state space representation and as a module.},
